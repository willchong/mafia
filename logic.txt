logic:

set-up.

players names are selected
players object is created

each player is an object with properties
	- alive (true / false)
	- status (silenced / slept / normal)
	- role (citizen, killer_r, killer_b, etc.)
	- team (citizens, killers_r, killers_b)
	- selection (player they chose)

every round involves 3 stages
	- action
	- result
	- vote

round 1 special things...
	red_killers wake up (tap on killer tiles to assign)
	red_killers choose target
	red_killers sleep

	black_killers wake up (tap on killer tiles to assign)
	black_killers choose target
	black_killers sleep

	doctor wake up (assign doctor)
	doctor choose target
	doctor sleep

	dentist wake up (assign dentist)
	doctor choose target
	doctor sleep

	prostitute wake up (assign dentist)
	prostitute choose target
	prostitute sleep

	inspector wake up (assign inspector)
	inspector choose target
	inspector sleep

TO DO -

inspector exceptions when sexed + default functionality [v]
write a disabled selection function [i think this is for... killers killing themselves, etc] or is this needed?
write ABSTAIN function [v]
find graphics and add them in upon assignments [v]
need an alert POST vote (prior to the next round) [v]
https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/ [v]

instruct narrator to read aloud IF a ROLE HAS DIED (disable selection) [need to check if dead, then special instruction + disabled buttons]
win condition screens!
--> full log?
make DEAD / SILENCED stampy things / selector icons
default recommendations for killer numbers
add "nothing happened"
fixed "NEXT" button? maybe more context...
Add "go back to sleep" alerts / helper text
Remove selection
